A small application to monitor your daily progress and log your experiences with a little Star Trek twist.

The application uses the questions located in your `questions.txt` file, write them one line at a time.
Use underline instead of space.

You can also add your custom insignia or use the default Star Trek one in the `insignia.txt` file.
